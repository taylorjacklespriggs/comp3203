I have added a new port for playback

You can find the port number from the udp discovery packet
The new packet format is

  4   4       24       Total 32
|---|---|-----...-----|
  L   P       VERSION

where L is the listening port for metadata,
P is the playback port,
and VERSION is a version string.

The new format is reverse compatible

Note:
datatypes are encoded as follows:
int: 4 bytes big endian
string: length as int followed by content
list: length as int followed by list
dict: length as int followed by key then value for all key value pairs

A thread is listening on P for a dictionary that is encoded
the same way as the metadata

If the dictionary received is { "request":"getinfo" } then
a dictionary of the info will be the response. The returned dictionary
has two keys currently:
    songs: an encoded string
            it is encoded as a list of dictionaries
            you will have to read the first 4 bytes as
            an int, then read that many dictionaries
            out of the string
            the list of the dictionaries is the metadata
            in order of playback
    status: one of "empty", "playing", "paused"

If the dictionary is { "request":"playback", ... }
then
    the dictionary must have a field { ..., "action":..., ... }
    this key can obtain values "play", "pause", "next"
    the dictionary must also have a field { ..., "password":... }
    the password is hardcoded to be "boxdigger" for now

good luck implementing!
